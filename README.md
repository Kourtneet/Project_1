# Musical Divas Data

## Project Overview

Our project embarked on a comparison between two iconic female artists, Beyonc√© and Taylor Swift, who held the spotlight with the two biggest concerts of the summer. We initially intended to use music streaming services (Billboard, Apple, etc) data to gauge popularity through metrics such as likes, clicks, plays, or downloads. Our team faced constraints during the analysis phase. We redirected our efforts toward exploring readily available song statistics to draw insightful comparisons between these musical powerhouses.

Questions we intended to answer originally: 
Which tracks have the highest number of listens?
Who are the most popular artists based on Spotify data?
Are there patterns in collaborations between artists?
Do certain collaborations lead to more popular tracks?
Are there regional variations in music preferences?

## Methodology

After two days of exploring the Spotify Web Developers page, it became evident that a more comprehensive analysis would require more time than available. Consequently, our focus shifted to an examination of artist data. The chosen parameters for comparison included aspects such as popularity, tempo, loudness, energy, speechiness, danceability, and valence. Considering the significant user bases in countries such as the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Germany, we aimed to discern if songs held the same ranking across diverse metrics in different regions.

## Artist Selection

Recognizing the limitations in obtaining data for multiple countries, we introduced Mariah Carey to our dataset. This addition allowed us to collect more data but also broadened the dataset. Mariah Carey's inclusion allowed us to provide a more comprehensive analysis.

## Key Observations

Our analysis unveiled that the popularity of a song appears to be closely tied to its loudness, with the two metrics exhibiting a strong correlation. This insight provided valuable information for understanding the factors that influence popularity of music and offers potential avenues for further exploration.
