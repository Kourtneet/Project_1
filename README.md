# Project_1
Musical Divas Data
Our project began by comparing two of the biggest female artists who had the two biggest concerts this summer. Beyonceâ€™ and Taylor Swift. We used Spotify to see who had the most likes, clicks, plays or downloads. After two days of reviewing the Spotify Web Developers page, Our Team decided we would need more time than we had available to complete the analysis. We did some research and then uncovered some readily available song statistics to compare the two artists. After discussing, it was agreed to compare Artists by Country, popularity, tempo, loudness, energy, loudness, speechiness, danceability and valence. The top four Countries that use Spotify are the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom and Germany. We will look at the data to see if the same songs were ranked in the same order in different countries based on different metrics. Pop is the most listened-to genre of music in Germany; Pop/Adult Contemporary is the most listened-to genre of music in Germany; J-Pop is the most listened-to genre of music in Japan; Rock and Indie is the most listened-to genre of music in the United States.
